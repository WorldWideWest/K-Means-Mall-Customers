## General info

We have a small dataset of 200 enterys from a shoping Mall. Our goal is to analyse the data and to clustter it.
Our goal for the analysis is:
* Analyse the Gender
* Analyse the Age
* Analyse the Income and the Spending Score

After the analysis we make our way to the clusttering and there we will use K-Means Clusttering from Sklearn

## Technologies

The technologies I will use here are:
* Python 3.7,
* Jupyter Notebook,
* Visual Studio Code,
